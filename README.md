		<summary>Dual Booting</summary>
		<br>
		For some reason, almost VAIO notebooks come from 2016 or older (I donn't sure about that!) didn't have any option in UEFI called: 'Boot Priority'. So, that mean there're many challenge come with that. To fixed this, we inly have 1 solution: Using EasyUEFI to custom boot entry! Download <a href="https://www.easyuefi.com/index-us.html">EasyUEFI</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		To add OpenCore and make it boot first instead of Windows Boot Manager (WBM). Please choose OpenCore.efi from /EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi

		<summary>OpenCore inject DSDT and BDOS issue on Windows</summary>
		<br>
		As you now, OpenCore are supported more OSes and faster than Chameleon (Legacy) and Clover!
		<br>
		Beside, there're also many error come with this bootloader. Like using DSDT instead SSDT. The main reason for this is there are lot of various kext support more hardware. That mean you needn't use DSDT anymore, only use SSDT and hot-patch. But the VAIO notebooks aren't! They required DDST to make macOS read their battery! (Basically, <a href="https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler">ECEnabler</a> didn't work with some VAIO notebooks, they need DSDT to read the battery). And that mean OpenCore will inject our patched DSDT to all OSes and it cause BDOS on Windows! 
		<br>
		Luckily, Olarila have make a version to make OpenCore didn't inject patched DSDT to all OSes. You can check this: <a href="https://github.com/OlarilaHackintosh/OpenCore_NO_ACPI">OpenCore_No_ACPI</a>

		<br>
		DSDT now is not required for my system, <a href="https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler">ECEnabler</a> can be used to make macOS detect battery and <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/BrightnessKeys">BrightnessKeys</a> can be used for hotkey patching.
		<br>
		I've tried using ECEnabler.kext and BrightnessKeys.kext for 2 months ago. Everything working fine but the battery isn't, it didn't show in the menu bar. When I pluged the AC Adapter, the battery just appeared at the same time. And that was the reason why I choose DSDT patched. For the brightness key, I just realized that if I don't put the DSDT.aml into /EFI/OC/ACPI, I can use the function key like normal. But with the battery problem, I think that sometime DSDT was the best choice than using SSDT with 'delayed' kext.

## Attention

- Some feature are not working correctly. Please report to me if you found any issues that didn't working.
- Please change the SMBIOS in my config.plist to your SMBIOS. You can use <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS">GenSMBIOS</a>
- I didn't tested this EFI in monterey. If you want to tried this, please add `-no_compat_check` or change SMBIOS to `MacBookPro11,4` (Recommended). You can fix HD 4000 by using OCLP (Required disable SIP)
